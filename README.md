# Astronomaly
A flexible framework for anomaly detection in astronomy.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Astronomaly is made up of two components: a python backend housed under "astronomaly", which can be used as a standalone library
or in conjunction with the JavaScript frontend, housed under "webapp".

## Warning

Astronomaly is being actively developed and may contain bugs or instabilities! I strongly recommend getting in touch with me if you're planning to use the code so I can help support you. Also if you're looking for light curve analysis (such as used in https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04666), this is still being worked into Astronomaly and will be supported in future.

## Documentation

The python documentation is hosted here and will be updated in the near future:

## Citation

Please cite Lochner and Bassett (in prep) if you use Astronomaly.
