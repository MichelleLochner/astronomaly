Setting up the environment
--------------------------

It's recommended to use anaconda to create an environment for Astronomaly. In
the main repository directory, type ``conda env create -f astronomaly_env.yml``
which will automatically install all required packages. 

Installation
------------

To install the python backend, use the standard ``python setup.py install`` or
``python setup.py develop`` if you plan to make changes to the files.
